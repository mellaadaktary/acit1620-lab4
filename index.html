        <p>Once in a vibrant town by the sea, there lived a mysterious street artist known as Luna. Every full moon, Luna would paint enchanting murals on the cobblestone streets, turning the mundane into magical.The townsfolk woke up one morning to find the entire town transformed into a whimsical wonderland. The once gray walls now boasted colorful tales of sea creatures and dreamy landscapes. Intrigued, they set out to discover the identity of the mysterious artist. </p>

        <p> Rumors circulated, but Luna remained elusive. The town embraced the enchantment, holding monthly celebrations during the full moon. As the moon waxed and waned, so did the stories on the streets.One day, a little girl named Maya stumbled upon Luna painting a new mural. Startled, Luna smiled warmly and handed Maya a paintbrush. Together, they added a touch of magic to the town, creating a masterpiece that captured the spirit of their shared imagination.</p>

            <p> Luna's identity was no longer a secret, but the town decided to keep the magic alive. Every full moon, Luna and Maya painted side by side, ensuring the streets continued to tell tales of wonder for generations to come. The mysterious artist had found a collaborator, and the town found everlasting enchantment in the art that adorned its streets..</p>

        <p> Welcome to my webpage, I have no previous expierence in web development. In just 4 weeks and 4 classes i have managed to learn all sorts of neat tricks which i can apply to my website. If you hover over this text you will see that the text changes in colour and background. This is due to the hover effect a pseudo element.</p>
            <p> This is the second part of my paragraph! I am very proud of this website as it has taken me a very long time to make. Although CSS has been very challenging for me Iv tried very hard to do my best. If you hover in other spots of the page you will see that it does some other hover effects (hint) hover over the home button at the very top</p>
                <p> Thank you for visiting the second part of my half of my website, in this short message I have spoken about having a lack of expereince and still managing to create awesome webpages just like this one. I also mentioned the fact that i used the hover effect to make certain parts of my page float and change colour. Although this might not be much for other its alot for me.</p>
